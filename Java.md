# Introduction Folder
In this folder we were refamiliarized with what the Java package entails. The JDK which is the development kit like an environment that contains a complier(Java C) , JRE(Java Runtime Environment) and JVM(Java virtual machine) used for execution of the java program.
we also understood how to have java fully functional on our system for us.All the step by step commands to have Java active on our system. We also learnt some basic terms and commands in Java.
we were also introduced to some basic java commands.

# Data Types Folder
In this folder we were introduced to data types in java. 
we have primitive data types that are built in java compiler but they have different functions and sizes. 
we also were shown how to check the size and range of a data type on java. 
I also understood that variables are names given to data types,meaning every variable must have a data type.They are used for storing data types. Initialization is storing data in a variable. Literals are constant values used in a program.They usually have data types as well.Unicode is a way of representation of letters and numbers in programming.

# Setup Java Environment
In this folder we were guided on how to properly install applications that will make writing programming languages easier and faster. 
Apache and Intelli J have great java environments for writing and deploying codes.

# Features and Architechture in Java
To understand machine code we need an interpreter and compiler in Java. 
It is inbuilt in the java kit and will do both the work of interpretation and compliation of the program before running. 
It is usually a behind the scene job, meaning we do not see it physically.
Java being Platform independent means java is able to run on various operating system.Java is famous for the acronym WORE, which simply means write once, run everywhere as it is made of bits that can fuction across various operating system.

# Operators and Expressions
In this folder, we looked at different operators in Java.Arithmetic operators the most common can be used on most data types except boolean. We also looked at increment operators and relational operators.
For Arithmetic operators, there is something called precedence for the operators as some operators take more factors than others. Increment on the other hand is just the increasing of number by 1 whenever the operator is used.B itwise operators help us work with individual bits of numbers, while bitmasking allows us to manipulate those bits to achieve specific tasks in programming.

#String and Class Printing Folder
Java has an inbuilt class called system and it comes with the "out" object that is static. The most famous print method is print and print ln. 
The difference between both terms is the "ln" which prints and then moves the cursor to the next line.
The print methods can be used for different data types. We also practised printing strings and the use of operators with them.
