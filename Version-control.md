Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. With version control, you can track who made changes, when they were made, and why they were made. It also enables collaboration, facilitates code review, and provides a safety net for reverting to previous versions if needed.
Git is a distributed version control system widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, and is known for its speed, efficiency, and flexibility. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, providing features like branching, merging, and distributed development. It operates locally on your machine, allowing you to work offline and commit changes to your local repository.
